# {{ @('workspace.name') }}

Please follow the below steps to get started, if you encounter any issues installing the dependencies or provisioning the development environment, please check the [Common Issues](#common-issues) section first.

## Development Environment

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

##### General

- Access to LastPass folders
  - `Shared-{{ @('workspace.name') }}-Servers` and `Shared-{{ @('workspace.name') }}-Accounts`

##### Docker

- A working Docker setup
  - On macOS, use [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
  - On Linux, add the official Docker repository and install the "docker-ce" package.
    You will also need to have a recent [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version - at least `1.24.0`.

#### Setup

1. Install [workspace](https://github.com/my127/workspace)
2. Copy the LastPass entry "{{ @('workspace.name') }}: Development Environment Key" to a file named `workspace.override.yml` in the project root.
3. Run `ws install`

Once installed, the site should be available at [https://{{ @('hostname') }}](https://{{ @('hostname') }}).

### Development environment cleanup

To stop the development environment, run `ws disable`.

To start the development environment again, run `ws enable`.

To remove the development environment, run `ws destroy`.

### Common Issues

As setup issues are encountered please detail with step by step fix instructions, and where possible update the project or the upstream workspace harness itself to provide a more permanent fix.
