# Go Harness for [Workspace]

To use this Go harness:

1. Install [Workspace]
2. Run `ws create <projectName> inviqa/go:v0.1.0`
3. Create an initial commit, ensuring that `workspace.override.yml` is not added to git.
4. Store the `workspace.override.yml` contents in a suitable location (such as LastPass).
